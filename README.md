Campus Suvidha is an all-in-one platform made just for college campuses. Its goal is to improve the overall experience of students, faculty, and staff. Campus Suvidha aims to make life on college campuses easier and more connected by offering a variety of features that have been designed to meet the needs of campus life.

## Key features

### 1. Buy and Sell Platform

Campus Suvidha provides a dedicated marketplace for students to buy and sell various items within their college community. Whether it's textbooks, electronics, furniture, or any other item, students can easily connect with potential buyers or sellers, fostering a sustainable and cost-effective exchange system.


### 2. Cab/Auto Sharing Platform

Tired of high transportation costs between the city and campus? Campus Suvidha offers an affordable cab and auto-sharing platform, connecting students to share rides. Save money, reduce travel expenses, and make commuting to and from the campus hassle-free.


### 3. Campus Forum

Collaboration and knowledge-sharing are essential aspects of campus life. Campus Suvidha includes a dedicated forum where students, faculty, and staff can engage in discussions, seek advice, and share valuable insights. This platform encourages a vibrant community, promoting a culture of learning and collaboration within the campus.


### 4. College Canteen (Coming Soon)

Waiting in long queues at campus canteens can be frustrating, especially during peak hours. Campus Suvidha simplifies this process by enabling students to order food from the canteen in advance and have it delivered to their desired location. This feature saves time, ensures quick access to meals, and reduces crowding in dining areas.
